        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        
        <p>
            After serving four years in my high school student council, I became interested 
            in expanding my leadership opportunities in College. 2021-2022 is my 4th year 
            serving in my Student Body Government, Student Association. The following are 
            some of the positions I've held as well as some of my other achievements:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 0%;">
    <dt>
        <b>Freshmen Representative, 2019-2019</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        As a freshmen representative, I strongly advocated for the freshmen class with fellow 
        freshmen representatives. In March of 2019, Student Association went to the Minnesota 
        State Capitol to lobby on behalf of the University. The objective of this type of 
        effort was to ask Minnesota senators and representatives to fund higher education 
        for the U of M system to the extent of which the University requested.

        <b>Systems Administrator, 2019-2020</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        I used Drupal Website Design to update congressional members profiles and 
        post updates about upcoming events. 
        I worked with our Rules and Elections director to keep everything up to date 
        involving our Fall and Spring Elections. I also initiated our newsletter program, 
        allowing us to inform the student body about what's happening in Student Association.

        <b>Representative at Large, 2020-2021</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        When COVID hit, Many questions flustered the University involving classes and tuition.
        As a Representative at Large, I worked with students and staff alike to adjust to the fully-digital
        college experience. We also began writing resolutions for a refund on our tuition given 
        that our education went online.

        <b>Rules and Elections Director, 2021-2022</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        As Rules and Elections director, my responsibility in this position is to ensure 
        that everyone, including myself, follows our organization's constitution and bylaws. 
        I am also in charge of running our Fall and Spring Elections for the Semester. 
        I currently hold this position in Student Association. Aside from my responsabilities,
        I am strongly advocating for my community as well as others around the world to get 
        vaccinated against the COVID virus in an effort to stop the spread of the COVID 19
        virus and its potentional mutations.
